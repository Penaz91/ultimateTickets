## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for taking interest and deciding to contribute to this repository!

These are the the contribution guidelines for issues:

- Before you submit an issue, please check the currently opened and closed issues for something similar, older information are always useful in analysing regressions.
- Please follow the issue template, this helps me a lot in quickly understanding what's going on
- If possible, attach a zip version of the stack traceback

If you want to contribute with code, please follow these guidelines:

- Many small commits are preferred rather than a larger single commit, this makes the code easier to review
- Please follow the Pull Request Template
- Before working on something, please check and leave a comment on the relevant issue (or open one), so that there is no duplicate work done.
